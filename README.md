LIFE-TRACKER is an AI-powered voice-based productivity assistant designed specifically for the **young workforce managing multiple tasks, responsibilities, and goals throughout the day**.

Instead of manually noting tasks, LIFE-TRACKER continuously listens to spoken conversations, thoughts, or voice inputs and automatically extracts, organizes, and schedules tasks discussed during the day. At the start of the next day, users receive a structured overview of tasks based on what they talked about the previous day.

The system aims to reduce cognitive load and manual planning by turning natural conversations into actionable task schedules.
